To address the excessive reliance of neural networks on artificially designed structures, we propose a self-evolving neural unit, E-KAT (Evolutionary KolmogorovArnold-Attention-Toeplitz Network), which employs cross-layer attention, Toeplitz matrices, and the Kolmogorov-Arnold framework, etc. It integrates features such as multi-head attention, convolution, KAN, MLP, and residuals within a single operator. Each structure has its own learnable weights and exhibits different levels of activity under various tasks, replacing the manual design of model types and sequences. By combining multiple neural units into ”neural clusters” and introducing a neuroscience-inspired ”threshold potential” system on the edges, the model spontaneously evolves complex superset structures into optimal sub-structures for specific tasks. Meanwhile, the model can dynamically adjust its width and depth according to task complexity based on the temperature coefficient T. 

This model possesses excellent physical interpretability and effectively addresses the excessive reliance of traditional models on manual architecture design. Experiments show that in the 1D bioelectrical classification task, E-KAT only requires a minimal 4-6 layer structure and achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy of 98.55% on the MIT-BIH ECG dataset [10]. In the WAY-EEG-GAL [9] (electroencephalogram) task, it realizes a 97.02% cross-subject decoding, outperforming baseline models such as ResNet-1D [2] and EEGformer [1]. In 2D image recognition, the model attains an accuracy of 91.8% on CIFAR-10 [5] with a 7-layer structure, demonstrating superior parameter efficiency and generalization performance compared to traditional single- feature models like Swin-T [7]. 

Experiments based on the DEAP [4] dataset further confirm that through the cross- task coupling of neural clusters, the model can comprehensively utilize the features learned by each neural cluster to achieve a mutual attention effect among different data sources. As a result, both the prediction accuracy and robustness are superior to those of independent task structures.
